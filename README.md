# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python
Programming Assignments from the Coursera Applied Data Science with Python specialisation

These notebooks contain the assignments from the Coursera course Applied Data Science with Python specialisation 
by the University of Michigan.

Note that the python library versions of the online Jupyter notebook system are out of date and the Autograder is 
temperamental so some answers have been edited to deal with this. The original assignments were coded in python using Spyder 
IDE and the most recent libraries then transferred to the Coursera notebooks for grading. 

The Courses in this specialisation were:

### Course 1: Introduction to Data Science in Python
Covered the basics of python for data science, the pandas library and simple data analysis
### Course 2: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
Covered plotting using the Matplot lib

### Course 3: Applied Machine Learning in Python
### Course 4: Applied Text Mining in Python
### Course 5: Applied Social Network Analysis in Python
